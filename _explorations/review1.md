[Nails by Pear's House](https://allegheny-college-cmpsc-105-spring-2024.github.io/resto-MinhChi88/)
is the top place that I would recommend for nail treatment. Not only do they carry every
shade of pink gel, but also, they care about providing the best service which results in
nails that are healthy and beautiful. The prices are totally fair, as listed out on the
[services page](https://allegheny-college-cmpsc-105-spring-2024.github.io/resto-MinhChi88/menu).

Recently I took my sister there, and she completely agreed that Pear's is the best!
I was also able ask for custom designs. They stick to their stated mission,
"We focus on growing your nails naturally, healthily, beautifully. We want to bring your nails a healthy, clean look. We are a all-gel nail studio. We do not use acrylics to perform any services. We use different kinds of gel to bring you the best experience at our studio. Quality is very important to us because your nail health is important to us."
